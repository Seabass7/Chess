# Chess
Chess game

Project using SFML

Instructions to add SFML to the project: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/ <br />
Check the "Getting started" section and follow the instructions. All required files are already in the project, they just need to be linked.


A more optimized version of the game is coming when I get some more free time.
